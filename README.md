# Desktop environment

My desktop environment for linux, based on suckless tools. Currently setup is for Debian based distros only.

## Setup

Run `./setup.sh`, it will do the following actions:
- Install dependencies for Debian (if the package manager is `dpkg`)
- Build dmenu
- Build dwm
- Build slock

##  Todo

- Status bar
- Decide default terminal / Set it up
- Automatically handle monitor attach/detach
